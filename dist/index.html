        <h3><a href="#">Exploring URIjs in a Pair Programming Team</a></h3>
        <h6>Written by <a href="#">MJ Grant</a> on August 12, 2014.</h6>

          <div class="large-6 columns">
            <p>Our mission was simple: as a pair programming team, select a node package not already covered in class. I teamed up with front-end veteran John Fahey for this project, and we selected URIjs as our node package. We (wisely) picked a package that looked simple enough to suit the time provided for the assignment. URIjs exists in service of mangling/de-mangling URLs as you see fit.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>The biggest challenges of this assignment were figuring out a use for URIjs and developing the JavaScript-based interface. John brought a lot of JavaScript know-how to the team, suggesting blur(), eventListeners, and the use of Browserify to make the node package available to the browser itself. 
            </p><p>Most of our work time was actually spent getting the front-end working. URIjs is well-documented and our goal was clear, but getting the user's input to render as we wanted took some trial and error.</p>
            <h4>Outcome</h4>
            <p>Our web app is simple but elegant. Type a domain into the input bar and then "try on" different TLDs to see how they look. Sometimes it's hard to envision what url is best for your brand, project, or new blog, and seeing it in a simulated Google search might help you make a decision. 
            </p><p>It's primitive now, but I could imagine expanding it into a nice little utility for domain shoppers. I'm not sure we really explored all the usefulness of URIjs, but for 3 hours I think we did pretty well.</p>
            <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p>Working in a pair was a great experience (as it usually is). From John, I learned several shortcuts, Sublime improvements, coding style tips, and a much-appreciated quick lesson in Browserify. I look forward to the next pair programming assignment!</p>

        <h3><a href="#">Creating a Heroku Blog App</a></h3>
        <h6>Written by <a href="#">MJ Grant</a> on August 11, 2014.</h6>
 
        <div class="row">
          <div class="content">
            <p>This blog is hosted on Heroku. Here's how it was created:</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
              <li>Create a new repo on Github</li>
              <li>Clone the repo onto your local environment</li>
              <li>Do your initial commit, then create a branch: git checkout -b workingbranch</li>
              <li>Follow <a href="https://github.com/ivanoats/JS-Blog-Yo-Browserify-Foundation">this tutorial</a> to make the actual blog: </li>
              <li>Make a heroku.com account</li>
              <li>Log into Heroku.com and set your Dynos to at least 1</li>
              <li>Run grunt build</li>
              <li>Follow these steps to push to Heroku: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#deploying-code</li>
              <li>Commit and push the blog to a branch on Github</li>
              <li>Make sure /dist/ is not in .gitignore</li>
              <li>Edit server.js: '/app/' should be '/dist'</li>
              <li>Push to Github</li>
              <li>Push to Heroku: git push heroku workingbranch:master</li>
            </ol>
            When grunt serve is running, the blog will be automatically updated in the browser as you work on it. This "quick preview" feature is particularly helpful when building the stylesheet.

            <p>This site was missing its css styles for a while. Luckily, the fix was simple:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>run <b>grunt build</b></li>
            <li>In server.js, change '/app/' to '/dist'.</li>
